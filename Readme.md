This is the first add on I have written, so please report any bugs on GitHub: https://github.com/ChrisK91/CardHeatmap/issues
Source code is available over there as well.

## Configuration
You can change the size of the heat map squares by editing */cardheatmap/cardheatmap.py*, and adjusting *maxCountX* to your liking.
